      <h4>Kamu</h4>
      <p>A fine place to have a coffee in Breda is Kamu. It is a bicycle store on the Boschstraat that also brews delicious coffees. Or is it a coffee bar where their love of bicycles is shared? You can fill it in yourself. In any case, I think it's a great coffee bar/bicycle shop/bakery in Breda.</p>

      <h4>Yirga</h4>
      <p>Yirga is an espresso bar in one of the oldest streets in Breda, namely the St. Annastraat. The small, light Yirga has a Scandinavian calm where the openness of the coffee shop is reflected. There is an open kitchen where fresh cakes are baked every day. You can take a seat at the bar while the barista makes your filter coffee. Whether you choose to open your laptop, read newspaper or want to enjoy a cup of coffee with friends, everyone is welcome at Yirga.</p>

      <h4>Koffie bij Teun</h4>
      <p>Coffee at Teun is the most famous coffee shop in Breda. The owner Teun (what a coincidence ðŸ¤­) started six years ago in a small dark coffee shop. In 2015 he got the chance to open his coffee bar in the renovated shopping center of Breda. "A specialty coffee bar in a mall? You shouldn't want that" many people said to Teun. That's exactly why he did it.</p>

      <h4>Koffiebar Sowieso</h4>
      <p>They serve the coffees at the bar, with the coffee beans being roasted in Amsterdam itself. For this, the owner Jop drives up and down almost every Monday to roast the fresh beans. And that's always handy, because they know exactly what's at the mill. The coffees are prepared with organic whole milk. Prefer not to use whole milk? No problem, you can also choose soy, oat, almond or coconut milk. Or are you more adventurous? Then order the changing blend and be surprised.</p>

You don't have to sit at the long table, but between 12:00 and 14:00, because of the crowds at lunch. There are many students working there, either working on a project or pouring your coffee. This makes this bar a bit studentish. Oh well ... you're also in a student city. So enjoy!</p>
