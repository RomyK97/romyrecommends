Project for Web Programming

Purpose of the project: My friends always ask me for recommendations for a place to eat or get coffee. I love trying new restaurants and would like to show my newest finds to my friends. I will do this by building a website that displays my recommendations for the best places to eat and have coffee.

How the website should be used:
Based on your needs you can select a topic, you can choose between coffee, food or shopping. If you are at the page of your choice, you can select to which city you want go. 

Future updates:
- Connecting locations with google maps
- Filter on type of diet
- Automatically use current location as a filter option
